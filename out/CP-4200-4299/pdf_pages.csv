Control panel (1LPV-PK2901-01) is for a duplex pump station with 3HP, 480V, 3 phase pumps. Control panel is
equipped with a Siemens Hydroranger level controller with Ultrasonic Transducer. All control logic is done in the 
Hydroranger via set-point control.
As the liquid level rises to the lead on set-point (1LSL2-291551) in the wet-well, the lead pump will start. It will stop
when the level drops to the off set-point (1LSL-291551). On the next cycle, the controller will call for the other pump
to operate in a similar manner. If, when the lead pump is running (1P-2909A) and the level continues to rise, the lag pump
(1P-2909B) will start. Both pumps will pump to the off level (1LSL1-291551). If the level reaches the high level
(1LSH2-291551) set point, an audible and visual alarm will occur. The audible alarm can be silenced by pressing the  
silence push button. There is also a high-high level alarm (1HLL-291551) which opens an auxiliary contact that can be
connected to a remote alarm. The high-high alarm will also activate the audible and visual alarm.
Pumps can be manually operated by turning the HOA (1HS-290050, 1HS-290051) switch to the hand position. This 
switch is a spring return switch which will prevent the pump from running dry if the switch is accidentally left on. 
There are indicator lights that indicate pump on (1XL-291504R, 1XL-291514R) and pump off (1XL-291504S, 
1XL-291514S) status. There are elapsed time meters (1KQI-291504, 1KQI-291514) that record each pump's run time.
There are also indicator lights that indicate if a pump trips due to overload. The overloads will require manual reset if
tripped.
There are adjustable seal fail relays that will stop the pump if the resistance in the sensing chamber of the pump reaches
the relay set-point value. A light will illuminate on the control panel if this occurs. The panel is designed for manual 
reset of the seal fail fault (1UA-291505, 1UA-291515)
Contact are provided for connection to the customer's remote system if necessary. All contacts open on failure. They are:
Seal Fail for each pump
1.
Pump Overload for each pump
2.
Pump Run for each pump
3.
High wet-well level
4.
High-high wet-well level
5.
Common Trouble Alarm
6.
4-20mA output indicating wet-well level
7.
There is a heater and thermostat which will turn on based on the set-point of the thermostat. The thermostat is adjustable
so that the operator may adjust the temperature at which the heater will turn on."

Control panel (1LPV-PK2901-01) is for a duplex pump station with 3HP, 480V, 3 phase pumps. Control panel is
equipped with a Siemens Hydroranger level controller with Ultrasonic Transducer. All control logic is done in the 
Hydroranger via set-point control.
As the liquid level rises to the lead on set-point (1LSL2-291551) in the wet-well, the lead pump will start. It will stop
when the level drops to the off set-point (1LSL-291551). On the next cycle, the controller will call for the other pump
(1P-2909B) will start. Both pumps will pump to the off level (1LSL1-291551). If the level reaches the high level
(1LSH2-291551) set point, an audible and visual alarm will occur. The audible alarm can be silenced by pressing the  
silence push button. There is also a high-high level alarm (1HLL-291551) which opens an auxiliary contact that can be
connected to a remote alarm. The high-high alarm will also activate the audible and visual alarm.
Pumps can be manually operated by turning the HOA (1HS-290050, 1HS-290051) switch to the hand position. This 
switch is a spring return switch which will prevent the pump from running dry if the switch is accidentally left on. 
There are indicator lights that indicate pump on (1XL-291504R, 1XL-291514R) and pump off (1XL-291504S, 
1XL-291514S) status. There are elapsed time meters (1KQI-291504, 1KQI-291514) that record each pump's run time.
There are also indicator lights that indicate if a pump trips due to overload. The overloads will require manual reset if
tripped.
There are adjustable seal fail relays that will stop the pump if the resistance in the sensing chamber of the pump reaches
the relay set-point value. A light will illuminate on the control panel if this occurs. The panel is designed for manual 
reset of the seal fail fault (1UA-291505, 1UA-291515)
Contact are provided for connection to the customer's remote system if necessary. All contacts open on failure. They are:
Seal Fail for each pump
1.
Pump Overload for each pump
2.
Pump Run for each pump
3.
High wet-well level
4.
High-high wet-well level
5.
Common Trouble Alarm
6.
4-20mA output indicating wet-well level
7.
There is a heater and thermostat which will turn on based on the set-point of the thermostat. The thermostat is adjustable
so that the operator may adjust the temperature at which the heater will turn on."

Control panel (LPV-PK2902-01) is for a duplex pump station with 3 HP, 480V, 3 phase 
pumps. Control panel is equipped with a Siemens Hydroranger level controller with 
Ultrasonic transducer. All control logic is done in the Hydroranger via set-point control. 
As the liquid level rises to the lead on set-point (1LSH1-292551) in the wet-well, the 
lead pump will start. It will stop when the level drops to the off set-point (1LSL-292551). 
On the next cycle, the controller will call for the other pump to operate in a similar 
manner. If, when the lead pump is running (1XL-292504R, 1XL-292514R) and the level 
continues to rise, the lag pump will start. Both pumps will pump to the off level (1LSL-
292551). If the level reaches the high-level (1LSH2-292501) set-point, an audible and 
visual alarm will occur. The audible alarm can be silenced by pressing the silence push 
button. There is also a high-high level alarm (1LAHH-292501) which opens an auxiliary 
contact that can be connected to a remote alarm. The high-high alarm will also activate 
the audible and visual alarm. 
Pumps can be manually operated by turning the HOA (1HS-292503, 1HS-292513) 
switch to hand position. This switch is a spring return switch which will prevent the pump 
from running dry if the switch is accidently left on.  
There are indicator lights that indicate pump on (1XL-292504R, 1XL-292514R) and 
pump off (1XL-292504S, 1XL-292514S) status. There are elapsed time meters (1KQI-
292504, 1KQI-292514) that record each pump’s run time. There are also indicator lights 
that indicate if a pump trips due to overload.  The overloads will require manual reset is 
tripped. 
There are adjustable seal fail relays that will stop the pump if the resistance in the 
sensing chamber of the pump reaches the relay set-point value. A light will illuminate on 
the control panel if this occurs.   The panel is designed for manual or automatic reset of 
the seal fail fault (1UA-292505, 1UA-292515). 
Contacts are provided for connection to the customer’s remote system if necessary.  All 
contacts open on failure.  They are:

Control panel (1LPV-PK2901-01) is for a duplex pump station with 3HP, 480V, 3 phase pumps. Control panel is
equipped with a Siemens Hydroranger level controller with Ultrasonic Transducer. All control logic is done in the 
Hydroranger via set-point control.
As the liquid level rises to the lead on set-point (1LSL2-291551) in the wet-well, the lead pump will start. It will stop
when the level drops to the off set-point (1LSL-291551). On the next cycle, the controller will call for the other pump
(1P-2909B) will start. Both pumps will pump to the off level (1LSL1-291551). If the level reaches the high level
(1LSH2-291551) set point, an audible and visual alarm will occur. The audible alarm can be silenced by pressing the  
silence push button. There is also a high-high level alarm (1HLL-291551) which opens an auxiliary contact that can be
connected to a remote alarm. The high-high alarm will also activate the audible and visual alarm.
Pumps can be manually operated by turning the HOA (1HS-290050, 1HS-290051) switch to the hand position. This 
switch is a spring return switch which will prevent the pump from running dry if the switch is accidentally left on. 
There are indicator lights that indicate pump on (1XL-291504R, 1XL-291514R) and pump off (1XL-291504S, 
1XL-291514S) status. There are elapsed time meters (1KQI-291504, 1KQI-291514) that record each pump's run time.
There are also indicator lights that indicate if a pump trips due to overload. The overloads will require manual reset if
tripped.
There are adjustable seal fail relays that will stop the pump if the resistance in the sensing chamber of the pump reaches
the relay set-point value. A light will illuminate on the control panel if this occurs. The panel is designed for manual 
reset of the seal fail fault (1UA-291505, 1UA-291515)
Contact are provided for connection to the customer's remote system if necessary. All contacts open on failure. They are:
Seal Fail for each pump
1.
Pump Overload for each pump
2.
Pump Run for each pump
3.
High wet-well level
4.
High-high wet-well level
5.
Common Trouble Alarm
6.
4-20mA output indicating wet-well level
7.
There is a heater and thermostat which will turn on based on the set-point of the thermostat. The thermostat is adjustable
so that the operator may adjust the temperature at which the heater will turn on."

lead pump will start. It will stop when the level drops to the off set-point (1LSL-293551). 
On the next cycle, the controller will call for the other pump to operate in a similar 
manner. If, when the lead pump is running (1XL-293504R, 1XL-293514R) and the level 
continues to rise, the lag pump will start. Both pumps will pump to the off level (1LSL-
293551). If the level reaches the high-level (1LSH2-293501) set-point, an audible and 
visual alarm will occur. The audible alarm can be silenced by pressing the silence push 
button. There is also a high-high level alarm (1LAHH-293501) which opens an auxiliary 
contact that can be connected to a remote alarm. The high-high alarm will also activate 
the audible and visual alarm. 
Pumps can be manually operated by turning the HOA (1HS-293503, 1HS-293513)

equipped with a Siemens Hydroranger level controller with Ultrasonic Transducer. All control logic is done in the 
Hydroranger via set-point control.
As the liquid level rises to the lead on set-point (1LSL2-291551) in the wet-well, the lead pump will start. It will stop
when the level drops to the off set-point (1LSL-291551). On the next cycle, the controller will call for the other pump
(1P-2909B) will start. Both pumps will pump to the off level (1LSL1-291551). If the level reaches the high level
(1LSH2-291551) set point, an audible and visual alarm will occur. The audible alarm can be silenced by pressing the  
silence push button. There is also a high-high level alarm (1HLL-291551) which opens an auxiliary contact that can be
connected to a remote alarm. The high-high alarm will also activate the audible and visual alarm.
Pumps can be manually operated by turning the HOA (1HS-290050, 1HS-290051) switch to the hand position. This 
switch is a spring return switch which will prevent the pump from running dry if the switch is accidentally left on. 
There are indicator lights that indicate pump on (1XL-291504R, 1XL-291514R) and pump off (1XL-291504S, 
1XL-291514S) status. There are elapsed time meters (1KQI-291504, 1KQI-291514) that record each pump's run time.
There are also indicator lights that indicate if a pump trips due to overload. The overloads will require manual reset if
tripped.
There are adjustable seal fail relays that will stop the pump if the resistance in the sensing chamber of the pump reaches
the relay set-point value. A light will illuminate on the control panel if this occurs. The panel is designed for manual 
reset of the seal fail fault (1UA-291505, 1UA-291515)

Control panel (LPV-PK2906-01) is for a duplex pump station with 3 HP, 480V, 3 phase 
pumps. Control panel is equipped with a Siemens Hydroranger level controller with 
Ultrasonic transducer. All control logic is done in the Hydroranger via set-point control. 
As the liquid level rises to the lead on set-point (1LSH1-294551) in the wet-well, the 
lead pump will start. It will stop when the level drops to the off set-point (1LSL-294551). 
On the next cycle, the controller will call for the other pump to operate in a similar 
manner. If, when the lead pump is running (1XL-294504R, 1XL-294514R) and the level 
continues to rise, the lag pump will start. Both pumps will pump to the off level (1LSL-
294551). If the level reaches the high-level (1LSH2-294501) set-point, an audible and 
visual alarm will occur. The audible alarm can be silenced by pressing the silence push 
button. There is also a high-high level alarm (1LAHH-294501) which opens an auxiliary 
contact that can be connected to a remote alarm. The high-high alarm will also activate 
the audible and visual alarm. 
Pumps can be manually operated by turning the HOA (1HS-294503, 1HS-294513) 
switch to hand position. This switch is a spring return switch which will prevent the pump 
from running dry if the switch is accidently left on.  
There are indicator lights that indicate pump on (1XL-294504R, 1XL-294514R) and 
pump off (1XL-294504S, 1XL-294514S) status. There are elapsed time meters (1KQI-
294504, 1KQI-294514) that record each pump’s run time. There are also indicator lights 
that indicate if a pump trips due to overload.  The overloads will require manual reset is 
tripped. 
There are adjustable seal fail relays that will stop the pump if the resistance in the 
sensing chamber of the pump reaches the relay set-point value. A light will illuminate on 
the control panel if this occurs.   The panel is designed for manual or automatic reset of 
the seal fail fault (1UA-294505, 1UA-294515). 
Contacts are provided for connection to the customer’s remote system if necessary.  All 
contacts open on failure.  They are:

PROGRAM Mode
The HydroRanger 200 HMI is programmed by setting its parameters to match your 
specific application. Most parameters are indexed, allowing you to set the parameter to 
specific conditions and to more than one input or output. When the HydroRanger 200 
HMI is in PROGRAM mode, you can change these parameter values and set operating 
conditions.
The HydroRanger 200 HMI’s primary programming is through the four-button interface. 
Please refer to page 109 for a full listing and explanation of parameter values.

Control panel (1LPV-PK2901-01) is for a duplex pump station with 3HP, 480V, 3 phase pumps. Control panel is
equipped with a Siemens Hydroranger level controller with Ultrasonic Transducer. All control logic is done in the 
Hydroranger via set-point control.
As the liquid level rises to the lead on set-point (1LSL2-291551) in the wet-well, the lead pump will start. It will stop
when the level drops to the off set-point (1LSL-291551). On the next cycle, the controller will call for the other pump
(1P-2909B) will start. Both pumps will pump to the off level (1LSL1-291551). If the level reaches the high level
(1LSH2-291551) set point, an audible and visual alarm will occur. The audible alarm can be silenced by pressing the  
silence push button. There is also a high-high level alarm (1HLL-291551) which opens an auxiliary contact that can be
connected to a remote alarm. The high-high alarm will also activate the audible and visual alarm.
Pumps can be manually operated by turning the HOA (1HS-290050, 1HS-290051) switch to the hand position. This 
switch is a spring return switch which will prevent the pump from running dry if the switch is accidentally left on. 
There are indicator lights that indicate pump on (1XL-291504R, 1XL-291514R) and pump off (1XL-291504S, 
1XL-291514S) status. There are elapsed time meters (1KQI-291504, 1KQI-291514) that record each pump's run time.
There are also indicator lights that indicate if a pump trips due to overload. The overloads will require manual reset if
tripped.
There are adjustable seal fail relays that will stop the pump if the resistance in the sensing chamber of the pump reaches
the relay set-point value. A light will illuminate on the control panel if this occurs. The panel is designed for manual 
reset of the seal fail fault (1UA-291505, 1UA-291515)
Contact are provided for connection to the customer's remote system if necessary. All contacts open on failure. They are:

Control panel (LPV-PK2907-01) is for a duplex pump station with 3 HP, 480V, 3 phase 
pumps. Control panel is equipped with a Siemens Hydroranger level controller with 
Ultrasonic transducer. All control logic is done in the Hydroranger via set-point control. 
As the liquid level rises to the lead on set-point (1LSH1-295551) in the wet-well, the 
lead pump will start. It will stop when the level drops to the off set-point (1LSL-295551). 
On the next cycle, the controller will call for the other pump to operate in a similar 
manner. If, when the lead pump is running (1XL-295504R, 1XL-295514R) and the level 
continues to rise, the lag pump will start. Both pumps will pump to the off level (1LSL-
295551). If the level reaches the high-level (1LSH2-295501) set-point, an audible and 
visual alarm will occur. The audible alarm can be silenced by pressing the silence push 
button. There is also a high-high level alarm (1LAHH-295501) which opens an auxiliary 
contact that can be connected to a remote alarm. The high-high alarm will also activate 
the audible and visual alarm. 
Pumps can be manually operated by turning the HOA (1HS-295503, 1HS-295513) 
switch to hand position. This switch is a spring return switch which will prevent the pump 
from running dry if the switch is accidently left on.  
There are indicator lights that indicate pump on (1XL-295504R, 1XL-295514R) and 
pump off (1XL-295504S, 1XL-295514S) status. There are elapsed time meters (1KQI-
295504, 1KQI-295514) that record each pump’s run time. There are also indicator lights 
that indicate if a pump trips due to overload.  The overloads will require manual reset is 
tripped. 
There are adjustable seal fail relays that will stop the pump if the resistance in the 
sensing chamber of the pump reaches the relay set-point value. A light will illuminate on 
the control panel if this occurs.   The panel is designed for manual or automatic reset of 
the seal fail fault (1UA-295505, 1UA-295515). 
Contacts are provided for connection to the customer’s remote system if necessary.  All 
contacts open on failure.  They are: 
 
 
1. 
Seal fail for each pump 
 
2. 
Pump overload for each pump 
 
3.

PROGRAM Mode
The HydroRanger 200 HMI is programmed by setting its parameters to match your 
specific application. Most parameters are indexed, allowing you to set the parameter to 
specific conditions and to more than one input or output. When the HydroRanger 200 
HMI is in PROGRAM mode, you can change these parameter values and set operating 
conditions.
The HydroRanger 200 HMI’s primary programming is through the four-button interface. 
Please refer to page 109 for a full listing and explanation of parameter values.

Control panel (1LPV-PK2901-01) is for a duplex pump station with 3HP, 480V, 3 phase pumps. Control panel is
equipped with a Siemens Hydroranger level controller with Ultrasonic Transducer. All control logic is done in the 
Hydroranger via set-point control.
As the liquid level rises to the lead on set-point (1LSL2-291551) in the wet-well, the lead pump will start. It will stop
when the level drops to the off set-point (1LSL-291551). On the next cycle, the controller will call for the other pump
(1P-2909B) will start. Both pumps will pump to the off level (1LSL1-291551). If the level reaches the high level
(1LSH2-291551) set point, an audible and visual alarm will occur. The audible alarm can be silenced by pressing the  
silence push button. There is also a high-high level alarm (1HLL-291551) which opens an auxiliary contact that can be
connected to a remote alarm. The high-high alarm will also activate the audible and visual alarm.
Pumps can be manually operated by turning the HOA (1HS-290050, 1HS-290051) switch to the hand position. This 
switch is a spring return switch which will prevent the pump from running dry if the switch is accidentally left on. 
There are indicator lights that indicate pump on (1XL-291504R, 1XL-291514R) and pump off (1XL-291504S, 
1XL-291514S) status. There are elapsed time meters (1KQI-291504, 1KQI-291514) that record each pump's run time.
There are also indicator lights that indicate if a pump trips due to overload. The overloads will require manual reset if
tripped.
There are adjustable seal fail relays that will stop the pump if the resistance in the sensing chamber of the pump reaches
the relay set-point value. A light will illuminate on the control panel if this occurs. The panel is designed for manual 
reset of the seal fail fault (1UA-291505, 1UA-291515)
Contact are provided for connection to the customer's remote system if necessary. All contacts open on failure. They are:

Control panel (LPV-PK2910-01) is for a duplex pump station with 3 HP, 480V, 3 phase 
pumps. Control panel is equipped with a Siemens Hydroranger level controller with 
Ultrasonic transducer. All control logic is done in the Hydroranger via set-point control. 
As the liquid level rises to the lead on set-point (1LSH1-296551) in the wet-well, the 
lead pump will start. It will stop when the level drops to the off set-point (1LSL-296551). 
On the next cycle, the controller will call for the other pump to operate in a similar 
manner. If, when the lead pump is running (1XL-296504R, 1XL-296514R) and the level 
continues to rise, the lag pump will start. Both pumps will pump to the off level (1LSL-
296551). If the level reaches the high-level (1LSH2-296501) set-point, an audible and 
visual alarm will occur. The audible alarm can be silenced by pressing the silence push 
button. There is also a high-high level alarm (1LAHH-296501) which opens an auxiliary 
contact that can be connected to a remote alarm. The high-high alarm will also activate 
the audible and visual alarm. 
Pumps can be manually operated by turning the HOA (1HS-296503, 1HS-296513) 
switch to hand position. This switch is a spring return switch which will prevent the pump 
from running dry if the switch is accidently left on.  
There are indicator lights that indicate pump on (1XL-296504R, 1XL-296514R) and 
pump off (1XL-296504S, 1XL-296514S) status. There are elapsed time meters (1KQI-
296504, 1KQI-296514) that record each pump’s run time. There are also indicator lights 
that indicate if a pump trips due to overload.  The overloads will require manual reset is 
tripped. 
There are adjustable seal fail relays that will stop the pump if the resistance in the 
sensing chamber of the pump reaches the relay set-point value. A light will illuminate on 
the control panel if this occurs.   The panel is designed for manual or automatic reset of 
the seal fail fault (1UA-296505, 1UA-296515). 
Contacts are provided for connection to the customer’s remote system if necessary.  All 
contacts open on failure.  They are: 
 
 
1. 
Seal fail for each pump 
 
2. 
Pump overload for each pump 
 
3.

PROGRAM Mode
The HydroRanger 200 HMI is programmed by setting its parameters to match your 
specific application. Most parameters are indexed, allowing you to set the parameter to 
specific conditions and to more than one input or output. When the HydroRanger 200 
HMI is in PROGRAM mode, you can change these parameter values and set operating 
conditions.
The HydroRanger 200 HMI’s primary programming is through the four-button interface. 
Please refer to page 109 for a full listing and explanation of parameter values.

Control panel is for a duplex pump station with 2 HP, 480 volt, 3 phase pumps. Control 
panel is equipped with a Siemens Hydroranger level controller with submersible 
transducer. All control logic is done in the Hydroranger via set-point control. 
As the liquid level rises to the lead on set-point in the wet-well, the lead pump will start. 
It will stop when the level drops to the off set-point. On the next cycle, the controller will 
call for the other pump to operate in a similar manner. If, when the lead pump is running 
and the level continues to rise, the lag pump will start. Both pumps will pump to the off 
level. If the level reaches the high level set-point, an audible and visual alarm will occur. 
The audible alarm can be silenced by pressing the silence push button. There is also a 
high-high level alarm which opens an auxiliary contact that can be connected to a 
remote alarm. The high high alarm will also activate the audible and visual alarm. 
Pumps can be manually operated by turning the HOA switch to hand position. This 
switch is a spring return switch which will prevent the pump from running dry if the 
switch is accidently left on.  
There are indicator lights that indicate pump on and pump off status. There are elapsed 
time meters that record each pump’s run time. There are also indicator lights that 
indicate if a pump trips due to overload.  The overloads will require manual reset is 
tripped. 
There are adjustable seal fail relays that will stop the pump if the resistance in the 
sensing chamber of the pump reaches the relay set-point value. A light will illuminate on 
the control panel if this occurs.   The panel is designed for manual or automatic reset of 
the seal fail fault. 
Contacts are provided for connection to the customer’s remote system if necessary.  All 
contacts open on failure.  They are: 
 
 
1. 
Seal fail for each pump 
 
2. 
Pump overload for each pump

Control panel is for a duplex pump station with 2 HP, 480 volt, 3 phase pumps. Control 
panel is equipped with a Siemens Hydroranger level controller with submersible 
transducer. All control logic is done in the Hydroranger via set-point control. 
As the liquid level rises to the lead on set-point in the wet-well, the lead pump will start. 
It will stop when the level drops to the off set-point. On the next cycle, the controller will 
call for the other pump to operate in a similar manner. If, when the lead pump is running 
and the level continues to rise, the lag pump will start. Both pumps will pump to the off 
level. If the level reaches the high level set-point, an audible and visual alarm will occur. 
The audible alarm can be silenced by pressing the silence push button. There is also a 
high-high level alarm which opens an auxiliary contact that can be connected to a 
remote alarm. The high high alarm will also activate the audible and visual alarm. 
Pumps can be manually operated by turning the HOA switch to hand position. This 
switch is a spring return switch which will prevent the pump from running dry if the 
switch is accidently left on.  
There are indicator lights that indicate pump on and pump off status. There are elapsed 
time meters that record each pump’s run time. There are also indicator lights that 
indicate if a pump trips due to overload.  The overloads will require manual reset is 
tripped. 
There are adjustable seal fail relays that will stop the pump if the resistance in the 
sensing chamber of the pump reaches the relay set-point value. A light will illuminate on 
the control panel if this occurs.   The panel is designed for manual or automatic reset of 
the seal fail fault. 
Contacts are provided for connection to the customer’s remote system if necessary.  All 
contacts open on failure.  They are: 
 
 
1. 
Seal fail for each pump 
 
2. 
Pump overload for each pump 
 
3. 
Pump run for each pump 
 
4.

Control panel is for a duplex pump station with 2 HP, 480 volt, 3 phase pumps. Control 
panel is equipped with a Siemens Hydroranger level controller with submersible 
transducer. All control logic is done in the Hydroranger via set-point control. 
As the liquid level rises to the lead on set-point in the wet-well, the lead pump will start. 
It will stop when the level drops to the off set-point. On the next cycle, the controller will 
call for the other pump to operate in a similar manner. If, when the lead pump is running 
and the level continues to rise, the lag pump will start. Both pumps will pump to the off 
level. If the level reaches the high level set-point, an audible and visual alarm will occur. 
The audible alarm can be silenced by pressing the silence push button. There is also a 
high-high level alarm which opens an auxiliary contact that can be connected to a 
remote alarm. The high high alarm will also activate the audible and visual alarm. 
Pumps can be manually operated by turning the HOA switch to hand position. This 
switch is a spring return switch which will prevent the pump from running dry if the 
switch is accidently left on.  
There are indicator lights that indicate pump on and pump off status. There are elapsed 
time meters that record each pump’s run time. There are also indicator lights that 
indicate if a pump trips due to overload.  The overloads will require manual reset is 
tripped. 
There are adjustable seal fail relays that will stop the pump if the resistance in the 
sensing chamber of the pump reaches the relay set-point value. A light will illuminate on 
the control panel if this occurs.   The panel is designed for manual or automatic reset of 
the seal fail fault. 
Contacts are provided for connection to the customer’s remote system if necessary.  All 
contacts open on failure.  They are: 
 
 
1. 
Seal fail for each pump 
 
2. 
Pump overload for each pump 
 
3.

1. CP-4236  is an engine control panel using Opti-Float float switches.  
2. Connect the 12 VDC power supply to + and – terminals. 
3. Connect all engine protection (shutdown) switches where shown. Panel is wired 
to accept both “close to trip” and” open to trip” switches. 
4. Engine can be started both manually and automatically. 
5. There is an adjustable time delay on starting (TD2) to allow the engine trip 
switches to reach normal operating position, e.g. oil pressure switch. Factory 
setting is 10 seconds. Adjust as is required for the particular engine. 
6. There is an adjustable cranking time delay (TD1) to allow the engine crank 
solenoid to remain energized for a reasonable number of seconds to allow 
engine to start.  
7. When running in automatic, the engine will start and stop based on the position 
of the float switches in the liquid. 
8. When running in automatic or manual, if there is an engine failure input, the 
engine will stop and can only be restarted after turning the HOA switch off then 
back on.  
9. If the engine stops due to engine malfunction, check the status of all of the 
engine shutdown switches to determine what caused the shutdown."
