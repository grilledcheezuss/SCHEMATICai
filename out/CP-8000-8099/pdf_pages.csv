E:\SCHEMATICai\samples\CP-8000-8099\CP-8012.pdf,13,612.0,792.0,"Control panel (1LPV-PK2902-01) is for a duplex pump station with 3HP, 480V, 3 phase pumps. Control panel is
equipped with a Precision Digital level controller with Non-contact Transducer. All control logic is done in the 
PD6000 via set-point control.
As the liquid level rises to the lead on set-point (1LSL2-291551) in the wet-well, the lead pump will start. It will stop
when the level drops to the off set-point (1LSL-291551). On the next cycle, the controller will call for the other pump
to operate in a similar manner. If, when the lead pump is running (1P-2909A) and the level continues to rise, the lag
pump (1P-2909B) will start. Both pumps will pump to the off level (1LSL1-291551). If the level reaches the high level
(1LSH2-291551) set point, an audible and visual alarm will occur. The audible alarm can be silenced by pressing the  
silence push button. There is also a high-high level alarm (1HLL-291551) which opens an auxiliary contact that can be
connected to a remote alarm. The high-high alarm will also activate the audible and visual alarm.
Pumps can be manually operated by turning the HOA (1HS-290060, 1HS-290061) switch to the hand position. This 
switch is a spring return switch which will prevent the pump from running dry if the switch is accidentally left on. 
There are indicator lights that indicate pump on (1XL-292504R, 1XL-292514R) and pump off (1XL-292504S, 
1XL-292514S) status. There are elapsed time meters (1KQI-292504, 1KQI-292514) that record each pump's run time.
There are also indicator lights that indicate if a pump trips due to overload. The overloads will require manual reset if
tripped.
There are adjustable seal fail relays that will stop the pump if the resistance in the sensing chamber of the pump reaches
the relay set-point value. A light will illuminate on the control panel if this occurs. The panel is designed for manual 
reset of the seal fail fault.
Contact are provided for connection to the customer's remote system if necessary. All contacts open on failure. They are:
Seal Fail for each pump
1.
Pump Overload for each pump
2.
Pump Run for each pump
3.
High wet-well level
4.
High-high wet-well level
5.
Common Trouble Alarm
6.
4-20mA output indicating wet-well level
7.
There is a heater and thermostat which will turn on based on the set-point of the thermostat. The thermostat is adjustable
so that the operator may adjust the temperature at which the heater will turn on.

E:\SCHEMATICai\samples\CP-8000-8099\CP-8014.pdf,13,612.0,792.0,"Control panel (1LPV-PK2906-01) is for a duplex pump station with 3HP, 480V, 3 phase pumps. Control panel is
equipped with a Precision Digital level controller with Non-contact Transducer. All control logic is done in the 
PD6000 via set-point control.
As the liquid level rises to the lead on set-point (1LSL2-291551) in the wet-well, the lead pump will start. It will stop
when the level drops to the off set-point (1LSL-291551). On the next cycle, the controller will call for the other pump
to operate in a similar manner. If, when the lead pump is running (1P-2909A) and the level continues to rise, the lag
pump (1P-2909B) will start. Both pumps will pump to the off level (1LSL1-291551). If the level reaches the high level
(1LSH2-291551) set point, an audible and visual alarm will occur. The audible alarm can be silenced by pressing the  
silence push button. There is also a high-high level alarm (1HLL-291551) which opens an auxiliary contact that can be
connected to a remote alarm. The high-high alarm will also activate the audible and visual alarm.
Pumps can be manually operated by turning the HOA (1HS-290114, 1HS-290115) switch to the hand position. This 
switch is a spring return switch which will prevent the pump from running dry if the switch is accidentally left on. 
There are indicator lights that indicate pump on (1XL-294504R, 1XL-294514R) and pump off (1XL-294504S, 
1XL-294514S) status. There are elapsed time meters (1KQI-294504, 1KQI-294514) that record each pump's run time.
There are also indicator lights that indicate if a pump trips due to overload. The overloads will require manual reset if
tripped.
There are adjustable seal fail relays that will stop the pump if the resistance in the sensing chamber of the pump reaches
the relay set-point value. A light will illuminate on the control panel if this occurs. The panel is designed for manual 
reset of the seal fail fault.
Contact are provided for connection to the customer's remote system if necessary. All contacts open on failure. They are:
Seal Fail for each pump
1.
Pump Overload for each pump
2.
Pump Run for each pump
3.
High wet-well level
4.
High-high wet-well level
5.
Common Trouble Alarm
6.
4-20mA output indicating wet-well level
7.
There is a heater and thermostat which will turn on based on the set-point of the thermostat. The thermostat is adjustable
so that the operator may adjust the temperature at which the heater will turn on.

E:\SCHEMATICai\samples\CP-8000-8099\CP-8015.pdf,13,612.0,792.0,"Control panel (1LPV-PK2907-01) is for a duplex pump station with 3HP, 480V, 3 phase pumps. Control panel is
equipped with a Precision Digital level controller with Non-contact Transducer. All control logic is done in the 
PD6000 via set-point control.
As the liquid level rises to the lead on set-point (1LSL2-291551) in the wet-well, the lead pump will start. It will stop
when the level drops to the off set-point (1LSL-291551). On the next cycle, the controller will call for the other pump
to operate in a similar manner. If, when the lead pump is running (1P-2909A) and the level continues to rise, the lag
pump (1P-2909B) will start. Both pumps will pump to the off level (1LSL1-291551). If the level reaches the high level
(1LSH2-291551) set point, an audible and visual alarm will occur. The audible alarm can be silenced by pressing the  
silence push button. There is also a high-high level alarm (1HLL-291551) which opens an auxiliary contact that can be
connected to a remote alarm. The high-high alarm will also activate the audible and visual alarm.
Pumps can be manually operated by turning the HOA (1HS-290079, 1HS-290080) switch to the hand position. This 
switch is a spring return switch which will prevent the pump from running dry if the switch is accidentally left on. 
There are indicator lights that indicate pump on (1XL-295504R, 1XL-295514R) and pump off (1XL-295504S, 
1XL-295514S) status. There are elapsed time meters (1KQI-295504, 1KQI-295514) that record each pump's run time.
There are also indicator lights that indicate if a pump trips due to overload. The overloads will require manual reset if
tripped.
There are adjustable seal fail relays that will stop the pump if the resistance in the sensing chamber of the pump reaches
the relay set-point value. A light will illuminate on the control panel if this occurs. The panel is designed for manual 
reset of the seal fail fault.
Contact are provided for connection to the customer's remote system if necessary. All contacts open on failure. They are:
Seal Fail for each pump
1.
Pump Overload for each pump
2.
Pump Run for each pump
3.
High wet-well level
4.
High-high wet-well level
5.
Common Trouble Alarm
6.
4-20mA output indicating wet-well level
7.
There is a heater and thermostat which will turn on based on the set-point of the thermostat. The thermostat is adjustable
so that the operator may adjust the temperature at which the heater will turn on.

E:\SCHEMATICai\samples\CP-8000-8099\CP-8041.pdf,19,612.0,792.0,"STANDARD WARRANTY 
 
Cox Research and Technology warrants all equipment to be free of defects in 
material and workmanship for a period of one (1) year from initial energization 
not to exceed eighteen (18) months from shipment. We will repair or replace at 
our option any defective component part or the entire panel returned to our 
factory prepaid provided that the equipment has been paid for or, without dispute, 
is scheduled to be paid for. No part shall be returned without first obtaining a 
Return Authorization Order. Our standard warranty is not a maintenance contract. 
We will trouble shoot on the telephone at no cost with contactors or customers 
qualified personnel at the job site to determine the faulty component. If we 
determine that repairs can or should only be made at the job site by factory 
personnel then we will provide the personnel on the site to make repairs at no 
cost. If in our opinion the problem is due to improper storage, abuse of 
components, incorrect or defective field wiring and components or anything 
external to the panel that caused a component failure, then the warranty will be 
void. This warranty does not cover reimbursement for labor, transportation, 
removal, installation, or any other expenses that may be incurred in connection 
with repair or replacement. We will not assume any direct or consequential 
damages, including but not limited to lost profits, lost income, labor charges, 
delays in construction, idle production, or liquidated damages. 
 
 
This warranty is expressly in lieu of any other express or implied warranty."

E:\SCHEMATICai\samples\CP-8000-8099\CP-8011.pdf,13,612.0,792.0,"Control panel (1LPV-PK2901-01) is for a duplex pump station with 3HP, 480V, 3 phase pumps. Control panel is
equipped with a Precision Digital level controller with Non-contact Transducer. All control logic is done in the 
PD6000 via set-point control.
As the liquid level rises to the lead on set-point (1LSL2-291551) in the wet-well, the lead pump will start. It will stop
when the level drops to the off set-point (1LSL1-291551). On the next cycle, the controller will call for the other pump
to operate in a similar manner. If, when the lead pump is running (1P-2909A) and the level continues to rise, the lag
pump (1P-2909B) will start. Both pumps will pump to the off level (1LSL1-291551). If the level reaches the high level
(1LSH2-291551) set point, an audible and visual alarm will occur. The audible alarm can be silenced by pressing the  
silence push button. There is also a high-high level alarm (1HLL-291551) which opens an auxiliary contact that can be
connected to a remote alarm. The high-high alarm will also activate the audible and visual alarm.
Pumps can be manually operated by turning the HOA (1HS-290050, 1HS-290051) switch to the hand position. This 
switch is a spring return switch which will prevent the pump from running dry if the switch is accidentally left on. 
There are indicator lights that indicate pump on (1XL-291504R, 1XL-291514R) and pump off (1XL-291504S, 
1XL-291514S) status. There are elapsed time meters (1KQI-291504, 1KQI-291514) that record each pump's run time.
There are also indicator lights that indicate if a pump trips due to overload. The overloads will require manual reset if
tripped.
There are adjustable seal fail relays that will stop the pump if the resistance in the sensing chamber of the pump reaches
the relay set-point value. A light will illuminate on the control panel if this occurs. The panel is designed for manual 
reset of the seal fail fault.
Contact are provided for connection to the customer's remote system if necessary. All contacts open on failure. They are:
Seal Fail for each pump
1.
Pump Overload for each pump
2.
Pump Run for each pump
3.
High wet-well level
4.
High-high wet-well level
5.
Common Trouble Alarm
6.
4-20mA output indicating wet-well level
7.
There is a heater and thermostat which will turn on based on the set-point of the thermostat. The thermostat is adjustable
so that the operator may adjust the temperature at which the heater will turn on.
