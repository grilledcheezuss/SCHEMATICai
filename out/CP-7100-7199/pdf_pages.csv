Combining new technology with a familiar device, the Opti-Float® level detector 
is a revolutionary innovation in discrete level detectors. It’s made of safe, 
recyclable materials. It’s mercury and lead free and is built to last for years of 
service. Rated for over 15,000,000 operations.
The design of the Opti-Float® level detector is amazingly simple. Using fiber 
optic cable, it transmits a beam of light from an LED in a remote transceiver 
down to the float, where the beam makes and breaks depending on the tilt 
of the float. When the transceiver detects the presence or absence of light, it 
activates a relay in the transceiver, which can then operate other devices. The 
transceivers are all dual DIN rail mounted units, that can connect to two floats. 
Additional transceivers can be used for additional floats.
The fiber optic cable, created specifically for the Opti-Float® level detector, requires 
no special tools for connection. And while it looks similar to other float cables, there 
is one huge exception: No electrical wires and inherently safe! So now, for the first 
time, floats can be used directly, without special equipment, in hazardous locations.
Patented. Other U.S. and Foreign Patents Pending.

OPERATION
The Duplexor is used in control panels where two loads are required to
alternate to provide equal run time on the loads. The alternating action 
is initiated by a control switch, which is common with one side of 
the control voltage. The output contacts will change states each time the
control switch is opened, thus alternating the two loads. The LED
indicators show the position of the output relay.
The ARA series is the standard Duplexor providing automatic alternating
sequence. The ARB has the automatic sequencing feature plus the
option of locking it into one sequence. A three position switch permits
the field selection of normal duplexing action, locking in the A-B
sequence, or B-A sequence.

General Information:
LP-CC LOW-PEAK Yellow™ Fuse
• A superior all-purpose, space-saving branch circuit fuse 
that meets most protection requirements up to 30A.
• Very compact; physical size is only ⁄‹Ω£™∑ ≈ 1⁄Ω™∑(10.3mm ≈
38.1mm) with rejection tip.
• The unique yellow color makes it easy to tell that the correct
fuse type is installed.
• Faster response to damaging short-circuit currents and 
higher interrupting rating than mechanical overcurrent 
protective devices.
200,000A Interrupting Rating
• Maximum interrupting rating for available fault current in
today's large capacity systems.
• Helps ensure that future growth will not obsolete the system.
Dual Characteristics
• Time-delay to avoid unwanted fuse openings from surge 
currents.
• Fast speed of response under short-circuit conditions for a
high degree of current-limitation.
• ADVANTAGE: The LOW-PEAK® fuse can be sized close 
to full load ratings for maximum overload and short-circuit
protection.
• ADVANTAGE: Can be used where either a time-delay or 
a fast-acting fuse is needed, making selection easier and
reducing spare fuse inventories for substantial cost reduction.
Superior Motor Protection
• For protection of small horsepower motor circuits.
• Proper sizing can provide Type “2” coordinated protection 
for NEMA and IEC motor controllers.
• Motors receive maximum protection against burnout from
overloads and single phasing.

ICM450
THREE-PHASE VOLTAGE MONITOR
All features and specifications subject to change without notice.
Stop Motor Burnouts!
Programmable 3-phase line voltage monitor  
with 25-fault memory, high temperature LCD  
display, easy setup & clear, diagnostic readout  
of system faults, 190 to 630 VAC operation...
The ICM450 was specifically designed to protect motors and 
other 3-phase loads from premature failure and damage due 
to common voltage faults such as voltage unbalance, over/
under voltage, phase loss, reversal, incorrect sequencing and 
rapid short cycling.
Mode of Operation
At power up, the ICM450 evaluates the incoming power for proper phase sequence, amplitude, and symmetry (voltage 
unbalance). If the three phase input at the line side connections is within user-set parameters, the load energize LED is 
turned on and the internal relay is energized. Continuity will be across terminals 4 and 6. If connections are made to the 
load side terminals, the ICM450 will transfer monitoring over to the load side only.  
When a critical fault condition (phase loss or phase reversal) is present, the relay will immediately de-energize, the load-
energized LED will turn off, the fault LED will flash, and the fault is written to memory. Continuity will be across terminals 
4 and 5.  
If a non-critical fault condition (unbalance, high or low voltage) is present, the ICM450 will ignore it during the interro-
gation delay time. If it is still present following the interrogation delay time, the relay will de-energize, the load-energized 
LED will turn off, the fault LED will flash, and the fault is written to memory. Continuity will be across terminals 4 and 5.  
The ICM450 will store the last 25 faults in memory. The relay will not energize if any fault conditions exist. The integral 
adjustable delay on break timer will prevent short cycling.

BACK OF PANEL
PANEL
STANDARD MOUNTING TYPES
Panel Mounting is obtained by cutting a circular or rectangular cut-out in
the desired panel and the instrument is inserted with the flange resting
on the top of the panel. The instrument is held in place by compressing a
plastic or steel spring clip from behind the panel. This type of mounting is
very popular because it requires no additional fasteners. Models are also
considered panel mounted when they are inserted into a panel cut-out
and mounted from the front using a two or more hole flange and
fastened with screws from the front of the panel (pictured to the right).
Back of panel mounting is usually achieved by cutting an opening in a
thin panel large enough to read the display. Two or more holes are
drilled in the panel and screws are inserted from the front to secure
the instrument against the back of the panel wall.
BASE
Base mounting is usually a free standing mount and connections are
made with a two or more hole flange at the bottom of the unit. This is a
standard mount for most mechanical counters and is sometimes used
for hour meters when a panel is not available.
PCB
PC board mounting is common for using counters in add-on PCB
modules to electronic machinery. This type of mounting eliminates the
need for any wires and multiple counters can be assembled as one
unit. The counters are attached by soldering the protruding pins into the
PCB and two or more fasteners are also screwed into the bottom of the
unit for additional support onto the PC board.
REAR
Rear mounting is similar to PCB mounting except there are no pins for
soldering, only two or more holes on the bottom for threaded or self-
tapping screws. This is an optional type of mounting used mainly when
a suitable panel is not available."

Dual Probe Level Control for Conductive Liquids

LED Indicator Reduces Adjustment Time
120 V AC Input Voltage
5 A SPDT Isolated Contacts
Description
The LLC5 provides dual level control in a
convenient octal plug-in package.  Models are
available for fill or drain operation.  Transformer
isolated AC voltage on the probes prevents
electrolytic plating.  Less than 1 mA of current is
used to sense the presence of conductive liquid
between the probes and common.  On adjustable
units, the sensitivity adjustment eliminates false
tripping caused by floating debris and foaming
agents.
Operation
Drain (Pump Down Mode): When the liquid level
rises and touches the high level probe, the output
relay energizes and remains energized until the
liquid level falls below the low level probe.  The
output relay then de-energizes and remains de-
energized until the liquid again touches the high
level probe.
Fill (Pump Up Mode): When the liquid level falls
below the low level probe, the output relay
energizes and remains energized until the liquid
level rises and touches the high level probe.  The
output relay then de-energizes and remains de-
energized until the liquid level again falls below the
low level probe.
