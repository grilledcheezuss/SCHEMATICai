PLC PROGRAM: 4594R4
OPERATION:
There are 2 sand filters. When the high level float FS-1 rises in filter 1, and remains up for
B01 minutes, the blower will turn on and solenoid valve 1 will energize for B02 minutes. This
action will loosen the particulate matter that was previously filtered out of the effluent water.
After this time, the blower will turn off and solenoid valve 1 will de-energize. The system will
remain off (dwell) for B03 minutes. At the end of this dwell time, clear-well pump 1 will start
and run for B04 minutes flushing the loosened particulate matter out of the sand and into
the mud well.
After this sequence, if FS1 float does not drop back to normal, the backwash procedure will
commence again after an off time of B01 minutes. If after a preset number of sequential
backwashes, set in B52, the system does not reset, then an alarm will occur but the filter
will continue with multiple backwash procedures. If no sequential backwashes occur within
the time set in B50, then the backwash alarm will stop and counter B52 will reset.
The same procedure will occur with filter 2 using its high level float FS-2, the blower,
solenoid valve 2 and clear well pump 2. See the PLC Block Settings sheet for block
numbers for filter 2.
If the clear well level drops to the off float FS-3 level, the clear well pump will stop. It will not
restart until the level rises to the restore float FS-4 level. This is to prevent the pumps from
pumping dry and being damaged. Also, if the water in the clear well falls below the low level
float, the blower will turn off until the restore float is made again.
The following blocks can be set for on delays of the accompanying functions:
B60 – Filter Blower
B61 – Solenoid Valve 1
B62 – Solenoid Valve 2
OPTIONAL: Solenoid valve 3 continuously opens and closes periodically aerating the clear
well based on the settings of the repeat cycle timer B09. The settings for B09 MUST remain
set to 0 for the ON and the OFF times unless Solenoid Valve 3 is utilized.
The mud well pumps will operate in standard lead-lag operation. When the level rises to the
lead float FS-6 level, the lead pump will start and pump to the off float FS-5 level. Pumps
will alternate on each successive cycle. If when the lead pump is operating, the level
continues to rise to the lag float FS-7 level, the lag pump will start. At this time both pumps
will be operating. Both will pump to the off float level. If the level rises to the high level float
FS-8 level, then an alarm will occur.
The system will reset after a power outage.

LEGACY HOMES CP-7005
PLC PROGRAM: 4594R4
OPERATION:
There are 2 sand filters. When the high level float FS-1 rises in filter 1, and remains up for
B01 minutes, the blower will turn on and solenoid valve 1 will energize for B02 minutes. This
action will loosen the particulate matter that was previously filtered out of the effluent water.
After this time, the blower will turn off and solenoid valve 1 will de-energize. The system will
remain off (dwell) for B03 minutes. At the end of this dwell time, clear-well pump 1 will start
and run for B04 minutes flushing the loosened particulate matter out of the sand and into
the mud well.
After this sequence, if FS1 float does not drop back to normal, the backwash procedure will
commence again after an off time of B01 minutes. If after a preset number of sequential
backwashes, set in B52, the system does not reset, then an alarm will occur but the filter
will continue with multiple backwash procedures. If no sequential backwashes occur within
the time set in B50, then the backwash alarm will stop and counter B52 will reset.
The same procedure will occur with filter 2 using its high level float FS-2, the blower,
solenoid valve 2 and clear well pump 2. See the PLC Block Settings sheet for block
numbers for filter 2.
If the clear well level drops to the off float FS-3 level, the clear well pump will stop. It will not
restart until the level rises to the restore float FS-4 level. This is to prevent the pumps from
pumping dry and being damaged. Also, if the water in the clear well falls below the low level
float, the blower will turn off until the restore float is made again.
The following blocks can be set for on delays of the accompanying functions:
B60 – Filter Blower
B61 – Solenoid Valve 1
B62 – Solenoid Valve 2
OPTIONAL: Solenoid valve 3 continuously opens and closes periodically aerating the clear
well based on the settings of the repeat cycle timer B09. The settings for B09 MUST remain
set to 0 for the ON and the OFF times unless Solenoid Valve 3 is utilized.
The mud well pumps will operate in standard lead-lag operation. When the level rises to the
lead float FS-6 level, the lead pump will start and pump to the off float FS-5 level. Pumps
will alternate on each successive cycle. If when the lead pump is operating, the level
continues to rise to the lag float FS-7 level, the lag pump will start. At this time both pumps
will be operating. Both will pump to the off float level. If the level rises to the high level float
FS-8 level, then an alarm will occur.
The system will reset after a power outage."

LEGACY HOMES CP-7005
PLC PROGRAM: 4594R4
OPERATION:
There are 2 sand filters. When the high level float FS-1 rises in filter 1, and remains up for
B01 minutes, the blower will turn on and solenoid valve 1 will energize for B02 minutes. This
action will loosen the particulate matter that was previously filtered out of the effluent water.
After this time, the blower will turn off and solenoid valve 1 will de-energize. The system will
remain off (dwell) for B03 minutes. At the end of this dwell time, clear-well pump 1 will start
and run for B04 minutes flushing the loosened particulate matter out of the sand and into
the mud well.
After this sequence, if FS1 float does not drop back to normal, the backwash procedure will
commence again after an off time of B01 minutes. If after a preset number of sequential
backwashes, set in B52, the system does not reset, then an alarm will occur but the filter
will continue with multiple backwash procedures. If no sequential backwashes occur within
the time set in B50, then the backwash alarm will stop and counter B52 will reset.
The same procedure will occur with filter 2 using its high level float FS-2, the blower,
solenoid valve 2 and clear well pump 2. See the PLC Block Settings sheet for block
numbers for filter 2.
If the clear well level drops to the off float FS-3 level, the clear well pump will stop. It will not
restart until the level rises to the restore float FS-4 level. This is to prevent the pumps from
pumping dry and being damaged. Also, if the water in the clear well falls below the low level
float, the blower will turn off until the restore float is made again.
The following blocks can be set for on delays of the accompanying functions:
B60 – Filter Blower
B61 – Solenoid Valve 1
B62 – Solenoid Valve 2
OPTIONAL: Solenoid valve 3 continuously opens and closes periodically aerating the clear
well based on the settings of the repeat cycle timer B09. The settings for B09 MUST remain
set to 0 for the ON and the OFF times unless Solenoid Valve 3 is utilized.
The mud well pumps will operate in standard lead-lag operation. When the level rises to the
lead float FS-6 level, the lead pump will start and pump to the off float FS-5 level. Pumps
will alternate on each successive cycle. If when the lead pump is operating, the level
continues to rise to the lag float FS-7 level, the lag pump will start. At this time both pumps
will be operating. Both will pump to the off float level. If the level rises to the high level float
FS-8 level, then an alarm will occur.
The system will reset after a power outage."
